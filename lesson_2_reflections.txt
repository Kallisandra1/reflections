What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initalizing a repository tells git what to start tracking. You need to do it because maybe you don't want everything tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows you to consider which files to commit before you commit them.
