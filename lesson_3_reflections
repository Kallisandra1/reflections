When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you local ever crashes you will have access to something remotely and other people can access it also.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
pulling allows for you merge changes that you want later

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks happen only on github - clones a repository
clones - takes it and makes a copy on your computer
branch - extending the repository in another feature direction
